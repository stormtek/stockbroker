 - Started project, wrote up design brief
 - Basic UI construction including panels for each company, player name and balance labels, and buttons for core actions
 - Added core concepts of game manager, company and player
 - Got basic initialistion working, including hooking company and player to relevant UI elements with updates to those values happening appropriately
 - Core framework in place but does nothing more than connect to UI at the moment

Next Step(s):
 - Implement Buy/Save behaviour

28/06/2020 (1 1/2 hours)
 - Implemented basic screen for buying and selling of shares
 - Hooked this screen up to interactions by the player to trigger buying and selling
 - Included first rough pass where shares are added / removed from relevant Company linked to the player and their bank balance is modified too
 - NOTE: no checks / balances are in place re whether they have enough money to buy shares or enough shares to sell
 - NOTE: basic screen does not show total costs for each transaction (by company or even as a total)

Extra steps still needed for buy / sell behaviour:
 - Validation re enough money to buy or enough shares to sell
 - Ensure that input fields can only take numeric fields (should just be ignoring non-numeric values at the moment)
 - Include totals (by company and overall) on the transaction screen, complete with +/- notation (and colouring?) in relevant direction
 - Track number of shares moved since last price update in the Company (hook is in place but does nothing so far)

 - Updated buy/sell screen to include dropdowns for values rather than text boxes
 - Added total/subtotal fields to track costs of various selected transactions on buy/sell screen
 - Added concept of max available shares a company has and made sure this is being adjusted on buy/sell action from player
 - This wraps up the core behaviour of Buy/Save for now, there is enough here to be functional at this early stage from an interaction perspective
 - NOTE: technically the player can go into debt buying shares, this could actually be an interesting feature, so keep in for now, there should be a penalty each quarter if you are in debt though

Next Step(s):
 - Add in concept of time, with adjustable time step, start doing basic share price adjustments
 - Figure out a way to display a graph of recent valuations

11/07/2020	(2 1/2 hours)
 - Created a project on Github, added Unity project to this
 - Found a Project on the Unity app store to do a basic line chart
 - Integrated this into the project and managed to get it actually displaying data
 - Added basic concept of time (days and weeks) and added hook to start updating the chart each week
 - Made some tweaks to graphing to adjust which side it starts to display from, hid relevant elements, ensured that lines are showing when spawned

Next Step(s):
 - Start doing price adjustments and have the graph update to show current share price rather than random value in range
 - Prepopulate company history so the graph is not blank to begin with
